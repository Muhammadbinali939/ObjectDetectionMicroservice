# Object Detection Microservice

This project implements an object detection microservice with two main components:
1. **UI Backend Service**: Accepts image input from the user.
2. **AI Backend Service**: Uses a lightweight open-source model (such as YOLO) to perform object detection on the uploaded image and returns the results in a structured JSON format.

The two components work together seamlessly to provide a comprehensive solution for object detection.
